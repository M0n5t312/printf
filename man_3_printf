NAME
        _printf

SYNOPSIS
        #include "holberton.h"

        int printf(const char *format, ...);
DESCRIPTION
	The function write the output under the control of a format
        string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or  arguments  accessed
        via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted
        for output.

	 Conversion specifiers
	 	    A character that specifies the type of conversion to be
		    applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

		    d, i   The  int  argument is converted to signed decimal
		       	   notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum
			   number of digits that  must appear; if the converted
			   value  requires fewer digits,it is padded on the left
			   with zeros.   The  default  precision  is  1. When  0
			   is  printed with an explicit precision 0, the output
			   is empty.

		    s	   Writes a string of characters from the array and are
		    	   written up to (but not including)  a  terminating
			   null  byte ('\0');

		    c	   Writes a single character on std output.
		    
		    %      A  '%' is written.  No argument is converted. The
		    	   complete conversion specification is '%%'.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters
       printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
